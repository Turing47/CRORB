## Introduction
This work introduces a novel approach to visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (vSLAM) that incorporates **Cylindrical Information** for localisation and mapping in sewer pipe networks. Our method builds upon the robust foundation provided by [ORB-SLAM2](https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2), extending its capabilities to exploit the unique environmental features of sewer pipe networks for improved accuracy and efficiency.
