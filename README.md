# CRORB
**Authors:** Rui Zhang, Rob Worley, Sarah Edwards, Jonathan Aitken, Sean R. Anderson and Lyudmila Mihaylova

This work proposes a novel visual Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (vSLAM) approach leveraging **Cylindrical Information** in sewer pipe networks. The approach is an extension of [ORB-SLAM2](https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2).
